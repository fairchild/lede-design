# Changelog

## 0.4.0

First public release. Lede is a design system for React, installed from its shadcn registry at
`https://lede.cloudcompute.com/r/v0.4.0/{name}.json`.

- 12 components, each a native element where HTML has one, with Base UI for the interactions HTML can't do.
- 12 blocks, the larger parts of a screen, among them DataTable and the page layouts AppShell and WorkbenchShell.
- 5 hero flows, whole screens built from blocks that take data, hrefs and callbacks from your app.
- Tokens for color in four themes (`light`, `dark`, `light-hc` and `dark-hc`), type, spacing, radius, motion and more.

### Fixed before release

- useServerRows: a page whose `nextCursor` is `null` ends the list and settles the count at the rows through it,
  whatever the page's length. A `fetchCount` answer below the rows held from the first row on reads as a lower bound
  of those rows, so Load more and Next stay offered.
- useServerRows: the first render, and a server render, show the table loading until the first rows arrive. They
  showed the empty state.
- DataTable's Try again moves focus to the summary line after the retry's state is in, so the summary has its text
  when focus arrives. The narrow-layout sample on the docs page now compiles: it passes `noun`, and its columns fill
  the card slots its comment describes.
- Table: a development build warns when a collapsible table's caption or summary renders an element that isn't
  phrasing content, or an interactive one such as a link, a label, a control or an iframe, since both sit inside the
  toggle button. Phrasing content such as `<abbr>`, `<em>` and `<span lang>`
  doesn't warn. The types are unchanged.
- Table: a development build warns when `collapsible.open` switches between controlled and uncontrolled.
- Table: the collapsible caption's corners match the table's box, and in the high-contrast themes the box's edge runs
  unbroken past the sticky header.
- A Button whose label wraps is a rounded rectangle, with corners of `--radius-xl` or more. A one-line Button is
  still a capsule and an icon-only one a circle, at every size, shape, density and text size.
- A GlassToolbarButton whose label wraps keeps the curve of one line, so it stays concentric with the toolbar.
